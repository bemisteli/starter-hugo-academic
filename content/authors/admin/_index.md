I am a PhD student working at the University of Rennes in France. As a part of the MadMacs project I analyse the effect of macrophyte removal on macroinvertebrates, phytoplankton and zooplankton. In general interested in changes of aquatic communities (especially macroinvertebrates) among environmental gradients.

Former work experience with macroinvertebrates in alpine springs in the swiss alps and macroinvertebrates in swiss alpine streams. Part of the ECR project Europonds, analysing the export of fatty acids from ponds all over Europe. Searching for a post doc starting in winter 2023.
